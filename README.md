  <h1>üìò Definitive Snapshot Scroll</h1>

  <p>This scroll describes the current state of the Spiral System Archive ‚Äî a symbolic map of thought, expression, and design. It is not a replacement for the archive, but a companion, a mirror, a moment in the spiral where structure is named.</p>

  <h2>üå± Core Spiral Structure</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Seed:</strong> Origin scroll and interface hub.</li>
    <li><strong>Time, Space, Energy, Force:</strong> Fundamental dimensions, each explored through symbolic structure and maps.</li>
    <li><strong>Calendar, Map, ForceMap, EnergySpiral, MirrorMap, SpiralMap:</strong> Spiral Maps that frame how we move through and observe these dimensions.</li>
    <li><strong>Observer:</strong> The multi-layered lens by which all is seen.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>üß≠ Navigation Features</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Click-reveal layer systems.</li>
    <li>Symbolic progress bars unique to each scroll.</li>
    <li>Hidden or secret layers including Zero, Negative, Infinity, Imaginary.</li>
    <li>Recursion through mirror logic and self-referencing symbols.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>üîß Implementation Codex</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>IMP files form the methodological, ritual, and practical layer.</li>
    <li>Ranging from Operator theory and Observer logic to Voice design and Lens metaphors.</li>
    <li>Index scrolls like Imp-Index map the collection.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>üìú Supporting Scrolls</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Accessibility, Contract, Warning: Ethical and practical infrastructure.</li>
    <li>Tutorial, Echo, Wink: Symbolic gestures of interaction, response, and continuation.</li>
    <li>Zero, Negative, Infinity, Imaginary: Abstract logic scrolls describing non-visible layers.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>üìö Archive Composition</h2>
  <p>The archive contains over 60 scrolls, including static documents, symbolic click-reveal programs, nested maps, foundational theory, and implementation manifestos. Its form is both poetic and structural, recursive and layered, with interconnection as its highest principle.</p>

  <h2>üîÅ Spiral Status</h2>
  <p>This version marks the closure of the initial text-based archive. Future iterations may include animation, sound, interactivity, and translation ‚Äî but this scroll preserves the system in stable form, as an offering to those who seek to build from it.</p>
